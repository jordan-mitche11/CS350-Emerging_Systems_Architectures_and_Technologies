CS 350 - Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies

**Course Description**

Students will explore emerging systems, architectures, and technologies. Students will be provided with an in-depth evaluation of emerging system architecture focusing on performance and the software/hardware interface. Emphasis is on analyzing fundamental issues in architecture design and the impact on application performance to enable better understanding of the concepts. Students will learn to evaluate software architectures, both established and emerging, and gain experience in determining when to implement architectures and technologies to fulfill business needs.

**Course Competencies**

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:
* Write interface software to control hardware components
* Analyze fundamental considerations regarding hardware architecture design and their impact on application performance
* Recommend and justify emerging systems architectures and technologies based on business requirements

**Module 8 Questions**

* **Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.** 

This project involved designing and implementing a smart thermostat prototype using a Raspberry Pi. The thermostat manages heating and cooling states, displays temperature data on an LCD, and transmits readings via UART. The goal was to create a basic thermostat system that could later integrate with a cloud platform for remote monitoring.

* **What did you do particularly well?**

I did particularly well in assembling the Raspberry Pi and sandwich board, ensuring all hardware components were properly connected. Additionally, I was confident in my Python coding throughout the project, especially in implementing the state machine and managing GPIO interactions.

* **Where could you improve?**

I need more practice with terminal commands, particularly when working with my Raspberry Pi. Instead of repeatedly entering my password for SSH and SCP operations, I could have set up SSH keys to streamline the process and improve efficiency.

* **What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

I plan to rely more on Linux command-line resources and community forums to strengthen my understanding of embedded systems. Additionally, I will look into using Git for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively in future projects.

* **What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?**

This project strengthened my Python programming, GPIO handling, and state machine implementation skills, which are applicable in embedded systems and IoT development. Additionally, my newfound experience with serial communication (UART) and hardware debugging can be beneficial in future work involving microcontrollers or sensor integration.

* **How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I made sure the code was thoroughly commented and modular, making it easier to understand and modify. Using descriptive function names and structured logic maintained readability. The state machine design allows for scalability down the line, allowing for integration of additional features like Wi-Fi connectivity and cloud control.
